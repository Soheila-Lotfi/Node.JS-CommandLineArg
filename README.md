By :

## Instructions

* Starting from a blank JavaScript file, create a Node application that takes in two command line arguments and checks if they are equal.
If the two numbers are equal then output: "true". Otherwise output: "false".

* Also Check if the two numbers are both multiples of 7. Again output "true" if they are and output "false" if they are not.

* what command to write in terminal:
Example 1: >node commandlinearg.js 3 4
false
false
Example 2: >node commandlinearg.js 7 14
false
true
Example 3: >node commandlinearg.js 7 7
true
true
